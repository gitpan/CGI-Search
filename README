CGI::Search
-----------

A simple way of searching a flat-text database for CGI scripts.


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

Email::Valid is required for the e-mail validator.
HTML::Template is needed for the template-able output.

Another module, CGI::Search::Config is also required.  It contains 
system-specific configuration information and is generated during 
the 'perl Makefile.PL' phase of the installation.


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you
unarchived this distribution and type the following:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

During the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage, you will be asked a question about 
the postion of the default cache dir.  This directory is used by HTML::Template's 
file_cache option.
